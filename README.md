# FPL-GameWeek-Predict
This is a data formatting and machine learning project using Fantasy Premier League Data from [Anand Vaastav's FPL Data](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League). This project uses the previous 3 weeks of data for a player to predict their fantasy points for the current week.
# Struggles and Goals
I plan on continuing to add more features from raw data into my formatted data set. This includes pulling the data about the opposing team and adding more categorical data that will be incorporated into embedded layers. I hope to turn this into a fullstack web app so that the network can be used to actually help players with their fantasy teams.
## Other Projects
1. [Fantasy Season Predictor](https://github.com/StrawberryFigbar/FPL-Season-Predict): A fantasy point predictor used for choosing your team for the upcoming season.
2. [Neural Network](https://github.com/StrawberryFigbar/Neural_Network): A neural network created from scratch that gives a better example of how these network work.
